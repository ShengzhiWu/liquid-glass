A front-end interactive liquid glass effect developed based on JS and Three.js. Features realistic physical behaviors and rich motion effects.

The dynamic behavior is simulated using a particle system, with morphology based on the metaball algorithm, incorporating refraction and dispersion. GPU acceleration is supported.
